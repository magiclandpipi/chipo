        `<h4>What is Chinese Seal Carving?</h4>`,
        `<p>Chinese seal carving is a unique art form in traditional Chinese culture, originating over 3,000 years ago during the Shang and Zhou Dynasties. Initially used to create seals, these stamps were symbols of power and status. The emperor’s jade seal, official stamps, and even the personal seals of scholars all relied on the intricate technique of seal carving. Over time, seal carving evolved from a practical tool to a form of art, becoming the “third art” alongside calligraphy and painting.</p>`,
        `<p>The heart of seal carving lies in the combination of “seal script” and “carving.” Seal script is an ancient form of Chinese writing, with round, flowing strokes that exude a sense of antiquity. The carving involves etching these seal script characters into materials such as stone, wood, or metal to create a distinctive seal. Though small in size, each seal holds the creator’s emotions and thoughts, reflecting their exquisite craftsmanship.</p>`,
        `<p>Today, seal carving is not only a creative outlet for art enthusiasts but also a unique cultural experience. Whether as a personal keepsake or a meaningful gift, carved seals are rich in cultural significance and memorable value.</p>`,
