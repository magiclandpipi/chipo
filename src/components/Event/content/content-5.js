    description: [
        `<p>Chinese ear picking is an ancient practice that has been around for over a thousand years. Once a popular wellness method for both nobility and common people, it blends Chinese medicine, acupressure techniques, and natural wisdom to provide a soothing experience. A skilled ear cleaner uses delicate tools like ear scoops, tweezers, and soft goose feather sticks to gently clean the ear canal, remove earwax, and massage the ear's acupoints, promoting better circulation. This helps release stress and leaves you feeling refreshed, with a clearer mind.</p>`,
        `<p>Chinese ear picking is a true treat for both your body and mind. It’s not just a wellness ritual—it’s an opportunity to experience a piece of Chinese culture while unwinding in a peaceful moment. When you visit China, don’t miss the chance to try this ancient tradition. Let the soothing touch of ear cleaning give you the relaxation you deserve, and experience the unique charm of Chinese local life.</p>`
